## Overview
I am constructing a phylogeny for a diverse clade of ground beetles (Coleoptera:Carabidae) known as the Trichosternus series.

## Data Source

I will be using DNA sequence data from four genes obtained from specimens in my lab.

In order to infer the historical biogeography, I will download, clean, and aggreggate data from the Essig Museum Database which contains locality information for my species of interest.

## Goals

1. Construct a phylogeny through parsimony, maximum likelihood, and bayesian inference. 

2. Reconstruct ancestral character of brooding, a behavior not known in other ground beetles (Carabidae).

3. Use locality information from the Essig Museum database to map species ranges and answer hypotheses about historical biogeograph.

## Adding records to NCBI 

No nucleotide information is currently available for species in the Trichosternus-complex. This project aims to broadly sample clades and make them available for public use.

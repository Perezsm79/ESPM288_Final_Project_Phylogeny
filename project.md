Phylogeny, Biogeography, and Ancestral State Reconstructon of Trichosternus series

Overview
--------

I am constructing a phylogeny for a diverse clade of ground beetles (Coleoptera:Carabidae) known as the Trichosternus series.

Data Source
-----------

I will be using DNA sequence data from four genes obtained from specimens in my lab.

In order to infer the historical biogeography, I will download, clean, and aggreggate data from the Essig Museum Database which contains locality information for my species of interest.

Goals
-----

1.  Construct a phylogeny through parsimony, maximum likelihood, and bayesian inference.

2.  Reconstruct ancestral character of brooding, a behavior not known in other ground beetles (Carabidae).

3.  Use locality information from the Essig Museum database to map species ranges and answer hypotheses about historical biogeograph.

Adding records to NCBI
----------------------

No nucleotide information is currently available for species in the Trichosternus-complex. This project aims to broadly sample clades and make them available for public use.
